# JavaDisassemble

An active attempt to disassemble the Java class file.
Eventually this aims to mimic the javap program.

Much of the code benifitted from the documentation on this webpage: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html

This code is still a work in progress. It doesn't do much, yet still contains some elusive bugs.
